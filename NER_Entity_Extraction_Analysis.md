# Metadata enrichment for RAG

## Context
During development and testing of the chunking system, we identified significant issues with the metadata currently present in the embeddings. Currently, the entity extraction approach that is polluting metadata fields and limiting the generalizability of the system across different document domains.

The current implementation uses hardcoded regex patterns specifically designed for financial documents, which creates several problems:
- Non-generalizable vocabulary that only works for financial/business documents
- Mixing of different data types (structural metadata, business metrics, processing flags) in the same fields
- Poor entity extraction quality that reduces RAG retrieval effectiveness
- Maintenance overhead due to hardcoded patterns

I have a hybrid search approach that uses both sparse and dense indices. The metadata enrichment really is just a way to improve the accuracy of my results. 

## Problem Statement

### Core Issue
The current entity extraction system (which was purely a regex search based on a manually created vocabulary set) has fundamental design flaws that impact RAG retrieval quality:

1. **Field Contamination**: The `metrics` field contains a mix of business metrics, table structural data, and processing metadata instead of clean entity data
2. **Hardcoded Patterns**: Regex patterns are hardcoded for financial terminology, making the system unusable for other document types
3. **Poor Entity Quality**: Current extraction produces low-quality entities like structural identifiers (`"row_header_0_Item 1."`, `"table_rows_27"`) instead of meaningful business entities
4. **Limited Generalizability**: System cannot handle documents from domains outside finance/business without code changes

### Impact on RAG Retrieval
- Metadata fields contain noise rather than meaningful entities for vector similarity
- Poor entity extraction reduces the effectiveness of metadata-based filtering during retrieval
- Inconsistent entity format makes it difficult to implement semantic search improvements
- Hard to extend the system to new document types or domains

### Desired Output Example
```json
"financial_entities": ["$16.1 billion", "revenue", "94%"],
"organizations": ["Elastic N.V.", "SEC"],  
"time_periods": ["Q4 2023", "fiscal year 2022"],
"locations": ["United States", "Netherlands"],
"table_metadata": {
  "structure": {"rows": 27, "cols": 3},
  "extraction_method": "content_match"
}
```

## Solutions Analyzed

### 1. Rule-Based with External Configuration
- Move regex patterns to external YAML/JSON configuration files
- Domain-specific pattern sets (financial, medical, legal, etc.)
- Runtime configuration loading for different document types

### 2. Use pre-trained spaCy models for standard entity recognition
- Can be extended with custom pattern matching
- Lightweight deployment (~15-750MB depending on model size)

### 3. Transformer-Based Domain-Specific NER
- Examples: FinBERT-NER, BioBERT-NER, LegalBERT-NER
- Higher accuracy for domain-specific entities, Slower processing (~50-100 docs/sec)
- Larger memory footprint (~440MB+ per model)
- By domain, financial metrics, product metrics, regions, dates, are individual domains. Correct me if I am wrong. 

### 4. LLM-Based Entity Extraction
- Most flexible but slowest and most expensive. I intend to avoid unless very v critical (rare)

### Accuracy Expectations
- **Regex Only**: 60-70% for hardcoded domains
- **SpaCy**: 70-80% for general entities
- **Domain Transformers**: 85-95% for specific domains
- **LLM-Based**: 90-95% with proper prompting

## Implementation: SpaCy-Based Solution

### Architecture Decision
Selected **SpaCy with optimization** as initial implementation based on:
- **Balanced performance**: 70-80% accuracy with 0.17s/chunk processing
- **Domain flexibility**: Works across financial, legal, medical, technical documents
- **Deployment simplicity**: Single model, minimal dependencies, no API costs
- **Production readiness**: Proven NER capabilities with extensive testing

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Components
1. **Independent Module**: `src/chunking/metadata_enrichment/spacy_extractor.py`
   - Zero coupling with existing pipeline - completely standalone
   - Plug-and-play architecture for easy integration or replacement
   - Configurable model selection (sm/md/lg/trf variants)
   - Graceful fallback handling for missing models

2. **Structured Financial Metrics Output**:
```json
{
  "measure_id": "revenue",
  "surface": "$16.1 billion", 
  "value": 16.1,
  "unit": "USD_billion",
  "currency": "USD",
  "scale": 1000000000.0,
  "qualifier": "YoY"
}
```

3. **Performance Optimizations Implemented**:
   - Text truncation (3000 char limit) prevents processing overhead
   - Pre-filtering skips chunks without financial indicators
   - Single-pass entity extraction across all categories
   - Reduced context window (10→5 tokens) for faster classification
   - Early termination in measure classification logic

#### Entity Extraction Categories
1. **Financial Metrics**: Automatic classification (revenue, expenses, assets, cash_flow, ratios, equity)
2. **Organizations**: Company names, regulatory bodies with false positive filtering
3. **Temporal Data**: Fiscal periods, reporting dates, time ranges with structured format
4. **Geographic Data**: Jurisdictions, operational regions, regulatory locations

#### Table Processing Enhancement
- **Original Problem**: Table chunks missing PDF metadata, only contained LLM-generated data
- **Root Cause**: Table captions stored in separate JSON text elements, not extracted
- **Solution**: Enhanced JSONTableDetector to extract contextual metadata from adjacent elements
- **Result**: 22+ tables now have original captions like *"The following table summarizes assets measured at fair value"*

#### Metadata Field Cleanup
- **Problem**: `metrics` field polluted with structural data (`"table_rows_27"`, `"extraction_method_content"`)
- **Solution**: Separated business metrics from structural metadata using dedicated fields
- **Clean Result**: `metrics` contains only business data (`["$16", "revenue", "1B"]`)
- **Structure**: Moved technical data to `structural_metadata` field

#### Content Structure Overhaul
**Table chunks now follow format**: Title → Original Caption → Summary → Actual Table
```
Our Cash Flows

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

Summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

| Year Ended April 30, | 2022 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|
| Net cash from operations | $5,672 | $22,545 |
```

### Performance Evaluation Framework

#### Benchmarking Protocol
1. **Processing Speed Measurement**:
```python
# Chunk processing benchmark
start = time.time()
for chunk in test_chunks:
    result = extractor.process_chunk_content(chunk['content'])
processing_rate = len(test_chunks) / (time.time() - start)
```

2. **Memory Usage Monitoring**:
```python
import psutil
process = psutil.Process()
baseline_memory = process.memory_info().rss
# Process chunks batch
peak_memory = process.memory_info().rss
memory_overhead = (peak_memory - baseline_memory) / 1024 / 1024
```

3. **Extraction Quality Metrics**:
   - **Entity Precision**: % of extracted entities that are meaningful business/financial data
   - **Coverage Rate**: % of financial values successfully captured and structured
   - **False Positive Rate**: % of extracted entities that are structural noise or artifacts
   - **Schema Compliance**: % of financial metrics matching required JSON structure

#### Current Performance Benchmarks
- **Processing Speed**: 0.173 seconds/chunk (45% improvement from 0.317s baseline)
- **Entity Yield**: 18 financial metrics extracted from 4,218 character sample chunk
- **Memory Footprint**: ~100MB (spaCy small model), stable across processing sessions
- **Theoretical Throughput**: ~346 chunks/minute maximum sustainable rate

#### Quality Validation Testing
1. **Domain-Specific Test Suites**:
   - Financial documents: SEC filings, earnings reports, balance sheets
   - Cross-domain validation: Medical research papers, legal contracts, technical specifications
   - Edge case handling: Non-financial tables, text-only documents, malformed input

2. **Integration Testing**:
